The folder contains a cpp file named "Discrete Math Puzzle" and a folder named "worst case steps computed".

Running the code:
The cpp file contains the code for the assignment and after compiling the code, the user must input the inital state of the 
puzzle. Note that 0 must be input for empty space in the puzzle. After taking the input the code does BFS and outputs the steps
to solve the puzzle.

Worst case folder:
The worst case folder contains the output for the worst case initial position of the puzzle which was given in the question statement.
There are four screenshots and the output is ordered starting from 1 and ending at 4. The reason for including this output was that it
took exactly 181439 states to be computed to get the output, which was done in a lot of time.
